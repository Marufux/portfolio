                Hello this is Maruf and I love to watch contents about entrepreneurship and startups. Also I am very
                passionate to invest my time on
                the path of successful business case studies. I want to start my career as an entrepreneur. Currently I
                am preparing myself to get in to that stage and hopefully I will be able to accelerat soon. I know this
                is going to be

                quite difficult neither impossible.</p>

                To Become an Entrepreneur
            </h2>

            <p class="des2">
                If you want to become an entrepreneur but worry you don't have the money for it, your finances don't
                have to
                stop you from achieving your goals. Many entrepreneurs seek the initial funding for their pursuits from
                external sources such as angel investors, who may provide entrepreneurs with capital to cover startup
                costs
                (or, later, expansion costs.) If you can demonstrate a high growth potential for your business, you can
                also
                turn to a venture capitalist, who offers capital in exchange for receiving equity in your company.
